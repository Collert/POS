This CSS framework is designed to change all standard HTML elements' look completely. Akin to Bootstrap, this framework is a collection of premade elements and aims to achieve a particular look for your websites. You can customize the default colours to suit your brand better. (See [customization](https://github.com/Collert/AD-Elements/wiki/Customization))
